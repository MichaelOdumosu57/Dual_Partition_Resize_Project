Backup your MBR just in case to further debug any problems if the new MBR is the 
your Windows 10 Home OS is licensed so definitely find out if you have a product key or a digital license
The product key is firmly hidden in windows, I show how to retrieve, [optional video clip here]
The digital license is deeply attached to your Microsoft online account, I advise to turn of extra security feautres
that would make it possibly difficult to reinstall system software if needed

Backing up your MBR

Your MBR is usually the first 2048 bytes on a hard drive which instructs the BIOS or UEFI on where to look to try to get
the system to boot into an OS


in linux ubuntu 16.04.5 terminal 

dd if=/dev/[internal hard drive] of=[/path-to-save/mbr-backup] bs=512 count=1

where hard drive information can be found with lsblk command
if you know you have one internal drive and are not using RAID find the section withgo to  the /boot MOUNTPOINT
in NAME that is the name of the partition on your internal drive and your internal drive is the NAME without the number
if this is not enough use sudo fdisk -l, which will give you very detailed information about the drives on your system

path to save mbr backup can be to a USB, favorably offsite your internal drive, it can be saved on any filesystem its just a piece of code

Finding out if you have a digital license or a product key that activated your Windows 10 OS 
and getting your product key

if not in windows 10 Home OS its best to go there 
go to https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html
find "Download ProduKey for x64"
go to the file explorer and unarchive it no need to extract
click on the .exe and select Run
find the line for windows 10 Home OS and copy and paste the product key is before C:/windows and is 25 digits excluding the NAME of the OS you also have to remove the product ID
but look at the grid to make sure

If you have a digital license you would have bought the OS from a microsoft store or a licensed retailer and were forced to make an online Microsoft account. if you have a local Microsoft account its likely you have a product key
