When you want to shrink a partition containing an OS what you want to do is make sure that youknow the original 
fresh install size of the OS partition. Then you want to remove all the uncessary junk and understand how large your 
OS becuase of system temp files, and additional files it creates as its setting up long term settings 
and any needed program on the OS then shrink accordingly. Make sure you clear you Recycle Bin or Trash so you can see these 
changes take effect

To remove software installed "extra files"


windows 10
these software like to bury theirselves in the system, when in the uninstall wizard try to tell it that you loved the software and want to install a better version
Win + R, appwiz.cpl to see all downloaded software
AVAST takes a very long time to uninstall
	in uninstall wizard choose AVAST caused too much problems with my software
WINZIP shouldnt be too tough
sometimes you need to restart in order to complete the changes
sometimes you cant even remove the programs settings
non-running programs can take up 20 mb -5gB of space but when they run they use a lot more  
if the size does not look right check the backups they might be the culprit

Shrinking your windows OS 

you need to backup all work in this OS in case anything goes wrong 
however if you have to reinstall there is an option which saves your work and puts it in a folder in the new OS
do not use MINI PARTITION TOOL to resize your partitions, and do not resize partitions when mounted
